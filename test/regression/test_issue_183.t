  The Colibri2 solver is not installed. You must install it through opam with the command `opam install colibri2`. You could also try to use another solver (have a look at the supported solvers here: https://github.com/formalsec/smtml?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-solvers). Note that installing the solver with your system package manager is not enough, you must install it through opam.
