{e Smt.ml} is a free and open-source OCaml SMT constraint abstraction layer
that serves as an abstracted constraint-solving wrapper, currently utilising
Z3 as its backend solver. However, future plans for Smt.ml include support
for other solvers in its backend, such as Yices and cvc5.

{1 Creating Solvers}

To begin creating solvers, utilize the modules provided in {!module:Smtml.Solver}
for Z3 encoding. The simplest approach to creating a solver in the Smtml
is outlined below:

{@ocaml[
module Z3 = Smtml.Solver.Z3_incremental

let solver : Z3.t = Z3.create ()
]}

For a comprehensive understanding of the solver functions and modes, refer to the
documentation {{:Smtml/Solver/index.html} found here}.

{1 Creating Expressions}

To provide constraints to the solver, it is necessary to first construct
expressions of type {!type:Smtml.Expr.t}. These expressions consist of two
key components: an arbitrary grammar expression of type {!type:Smtml.Expr.expr}
for building logical expressions, and a theory annotation of type {!type:Smtml.Ty.t}
that informs the SMT solver about the theory in which to encode our expressions.
The combination of these two components is achieved using the constructors
[unop], [binop], [relop], etc.

As an illustration, consider the creation of the logical formula equivalent to
[not (not x) = x]:

{@ocaml[
open Smtml
open Ty
open Expr

(* Creating a symbol *)
let x = mk_symbol Symbol.("x" @: Ty_bool)

(* Creating unary operations *)
let not_x : Expr.t = unop Ty_bool Not x
let not_not_x : Expr.t = unop Ty_bool Not not_x

(* Creating the equality *)
let expr : Expr.t = relop Ty_bool Eq not_not_x x
]}

Once our proposition is encoded in the abstract grammar, it can be passed to
the solver for verification:

{@ocaml[
let () =
  Z3.add solver [ expr ];
  assert (Z3.check solver [])
]}

{1 Retreiving Values from the Solver}

In many cases, the ability to swiftly retrieve concrete values or sets of values
from a set of satisfiable constraints proves to be immensely beneficial. The
Encoding facilitates this process through two essential functions:

+ {!val:Smtml.Solver_intf.S.get_value} allows the retrieval of a single value
  from the solver.
+ {!val:Smtml.Solver_intf.S.model} enables the retrieval of all possible assignments
  within our constraints.

To illustrate, let's consider retrieving the value of [x] from our previous example:

{@ocaml[
let () =
  Z3.add solver [ expr ];
  assert (Z3.check solver []);
  let v = Z3.get_value solver x in
  Format.printf "x = %a@." Expr.pp v
]}

In this snippet, we add our constraint to the solver, ensure its satisfiability,
and then retrieve the value of [x]. The retrieved value is subsequently formatted
for display using the Format module.
