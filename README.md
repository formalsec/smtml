# Smt.ml [![Build badge](https://github.com/formalsec/smtml/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/formalsec/smtml/actions) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/formalsec/smtml/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/github/formalsec/smtml) [![MIT](https://img.shields.io/github/license/formalsec/smtml)](LICENSE) ![Platform](https://img.shields.io/badge/platform-linux%20%7C%20macos-lightgrey)

Smt.ml is a Multi Back-end Front-end for SMT Solvers in OCaml. The primary
objective of Smt.ml is to facilitate the effortless transition between
different SMT solvers during program analysis, as certain SMT solvers may prove
more efficient at handling specific logics and formulas. Presently, Smt.ml
offers support for [Z3], [Colibri2], [Bitwuzla], and [Alt-Ergo], and ongoing
efforts are directed towards incorporating support for [cvc5].

## Installation

### OPAM

Install [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html) and bootstrap the OCaml compiler:

```sh
opam init
opam switch create 5.1.1 5.1.1
```

Then install encoding:

```sh
opam install smtml
```

### Build from source

Clone the repo and install the dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/formalsec/smtml.git
cd smtml
opam install . --deps-only --with-test
```

Build and test:

```sh
dune build @install
dune runtest
```

Install `smtml` on your path by running:

```sh
dune install
```

### Code Coverage Reports

```sh
BISECT_FILE=`pwd`/bisect dune runtest --force --instrument-with bisect_ppx
bisect-ppx-report summary # Shell summary

## About

### Project Name

The name `Smt.ml` is a portmanteau of the terms `SMT` and `OCaml`. The `.ml`
extension is a common file extension for OCaml source files. The library itself
is named `smtml` and can be imported into OCaml programs using the following
syntax:

```ocaml
open Smtml
```
